# Cursor Rules for Sorrento Web Project

## Documentation Guidelines

**NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) unless explicitly requested by the user.**

This includes but is not limited to:
- Progress reports (e.g., REDESIGN_PROGRESS.md, CMS_MIGRATION_STATUS.md)
- Completion summaries (e.g., INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md, PRODUCTION_READY.md)
- Implementation guides (e.g., SEO_IMPLEMENTATION.md, SANITY_SETUP.md)
- Status updates (e.g., DEPLOYMENT_SUCCESS.md, REMAINING_PAGES.md)
- Any other agent-generated documentation files

Instead:
- Provide summaries and reports directly in the conversation
- Only create documentation files when the user explicitly asks for them
- Keep the repository clean and focused on actual code

## Project Context

This is a SvelteKit-based web application for Sorrento tourism with:
- Internationalization support (en, it)
- Sanity CMS integration
- TailwindCSS styling
- Shadcn-svelte UI components

When working on this project:
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Test changes before considering them complete
- Update existing files rather than creating new ones unnecessarily
